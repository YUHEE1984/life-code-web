    <p>hello <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="web wiki">web</a>. 내 남자친구를 소개해줄게.<br>
    My lovely and smart boyfriend was born on October 3, 1987.
    He is a Florida man. 
    That's why he sometimes shows a strange identity.<br>
    Still, <strong>he is a very <u>good</u> <u>boyfriend</u></strong> most of the time.
    Because he is very kind and teaches me computers even in difficult communication courses.</p>
    <p>For things I don't understand in his English computer class, I take Korean YouTube lectures separately.
    After that, when I review his lessons, the puzzles fit together like magic.<br>
    I want to become a great developer like him soon.
    Actually, I want to be a better developer than that.
    I am really greedy with the desire to make 10 years of time go dark.</p>
    <p>But still, I want to make that wish come true quickly.
    The result of that wish will give me the freedom of time and financial choice, and at the same time it will give me the freedom to distribute my abundant resources to the precious people around me.<br>
    At that time, I want to give my boyfriend the freedom of time to fulfill his dream. 
    Like he's helping me now.<br>
    I think this is a virtuous cycle of a really good relationship.<br>
    So I am studying now.</p>
